  The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 (NATO reporting name Fishbed) is a supersonic jet 
  fighter and interceptor aircraft, designed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau 
  in the Soviet Union. Its nicknames include "Balalaika", because its planform 
  resembles the stringed musical instrument of the same name; "Ołówek", Polish for 
  "pencil", due to the shape of its fuselage, and "Én Bạc", meaning "silver swallow", 
  in Vietnamese.
  Approximately 60 countries across four continents have flown the MiG-21, and it 
  still serves many nations seven decades after its maiden flight. It set aviation 
  records, becoming the most-produced supersonic jet aircraft in aviation history, 
  the most-produced combat aircraft since the Korean War and, previously, the longest 
  production run of any combat aircraft. 
  The MiG-21 jet fighter was a continuation of Soviet jet fighters, starting with the 
  subsonic MiG-15 and MiG-17, and the supersonic MiG-19. A number of experimental 
  Mach 2 Soviet designs were based on nose intakes with either swept-back wings, 
  such as the Sukhoi Su-7, or tailed deltas, of which the MiG-21 would be the 
  most successful.
