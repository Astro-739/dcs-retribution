  The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 (NATO reporting name Fresco) is a high-subsonic fighter 
  aircraft produced in the Soviet Union from 1952 and was operated by air forces 
  internationally. The MiG-17 was license-built in China as the Shenyang J-5 and 
  Poland as the PZL-Mielec Lim-6. The MiG-17 is still being used by the North Korean 
  air force in the present day and has seen combat in the Middle East and Asia.
  The MiG-17 was an advanced modification of the MiG-15 aircraft produced by the 
  Soviet Union during the Korean War. Production of the MiG-17 was too late for use 
  in that conflict and was first used in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958. 
  While the MiG-17 was designed to shoot down slower American bombers, it showed 
  surprising success when used by North Vietnamese pilots to combat American 
  fighters and fighter-bombers during the Vietnam War, nearly a decade after its 
  initial design. This was due to the MiG-17 being more agile and maneuverable than 
  the American F-4 Phantom and F-105 Thunderchief, which were focused on speed and 
  long range combat, as well as the fact that MiG-17 was armed with guns, which 
  initial models of the F-4 Phantom lacked.
