  The Kaman SH-2 Seasprite is a ship-based helicopter originally developed and 
  produced by American manufacturer Kaman Aircraft Corporation. It has been 
  typically used as a compact and fast-moving rotorcraft for utility and 
  anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. Early on it was modest sized 
  single-engined naval utility helicopter, and progressed to twin-engine ASW 
  and SAR, and the latest model served well into the 21st century, with G model 
  in active service in the 2020s with Egypt, New Zealand, Peru, and Poland.
  In the late-1960s, without further orders Kaman decided to terminate production 
  after completing the USN order of 184 H-2s. However, in 1971, production was 
  restarted for the improved SH-2F to operate from older frigates. This ability 
  meant it stayed in service to the end of the century, as even with the 
  introduction of the newer, larger and overall more capable Sikorsky SH-60 
  Sea Hawk which entered service starting in the mid-1980s, but it could not 
  operate safety from the smaller flight decks like the smaller Seasprite.
