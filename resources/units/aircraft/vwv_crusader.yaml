  The Vought F-8 Crusader (originally F8U) is a single-engine, supersonic, 
  carrier-based air superiority jet aircraft designed and produced by the American 
  aircraft manufacturer Vought. It was the last American fighter that had guns as 
  the primary weapon, earning it the title "The Last of the Gunfighters". 
  On 21 August 1956, U.S. Navy pilot R.W. Windsor attained a top speed of 1,015 mph; 
  in doing so, the F-8 became the first jet fighter in American service to reach 
  1,000 mph.
  During March 1957, the F-8 was introduced into regular operations with the US Navy. 
  In addition to the Navy, the type was also operated by the United States Marine Corps 
  (replacing the Vought F7U Cutlass), the French Navy, and the Philippine Air Force. 
  Early on, the type experienced an above-average mishap rate, being somewhat difficult 
  to pilot. American F-8s saw active combat during the Vietnam War, engaging in multiple 
  dogfights with MiG-17s of the Vietnam People's Air Force as well as performing ground 
  attack missions in the theatre.
