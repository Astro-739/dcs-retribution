description:
  In the early 1980s, while comparative tests of the V-80 (Ka-50 prototype) and the Mi-28 were being conducted, 
  the Kamov design team came up with a proposal to develop a dedicated helicopter to conduct battlefield 
  reconnaissance, provide target designation, support and coordinate group attack helicopter operations based on 
  the Ka-60. However, the economic hardships that hit the nation in the late 1980s hampered this new development 
  program. This prompted Kamov's Designer General to choose a modified version of Ka-50 on which to install the 
  reconnaissance and target designation system. The modified "Black Shark" required a second crew member to 
  operate the optotronics/radar reconnaissance suite. Kamov decided to use side-by-side seating arrangement, 
  due to the verified improvements in co-operation between the crew members. This twin-seat version was 
  designated Ka-52.
