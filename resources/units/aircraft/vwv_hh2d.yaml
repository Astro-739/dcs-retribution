  The Kaman SH-2 Seasprite is a ship-based helicopter originally developed and 
  produced by American manufacturer Kaman Aircraft Corporation. It has been 
  typically used as a compact and fast-moving rotorcraft for utility and 
  anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. Early on it was modest sized 
  single-engined naval utility helicopter, and progressed to twin-engine ASW 
  and SAR, and the latest model served well into the 21st century, with G model 
  in active service in the 2020s with Egypt, New Zealand, Peru, and Poland.
  In October 1970, the UH-2 was selected as the interim Light Airborne 
  Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopter. LAMPS evolved during the 1960s from 
  an urgent requirement to provide non-aviation ships with manned support and 
  ASW helicopters. The "LAMPS Mark I" suite included advanced sensors, 
  processors, and display capabilities. H-2s upgraded with LAMPS were called 
  SH-2Ds, and became mobile radar and sonar platforms that enhanced the 
  situational awareness of ships. The SH-2D first flew on 16 March 1971.
  HH-2D was a search and rescue version.
