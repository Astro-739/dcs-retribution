  The Douglas A-1 Skyraider (formerly designated AD before the 1962 unification of 
  Navy and Air Force designations) is an American single-seat attack aircraft in service 
  from 1946 to the early 1980s, which served during the Korean War and Vietnam War. 
  The Skyraider had an unusually long career, remaining in frontline service well into 
  the Jet Age (when most piston-engine attack or fighter aircraft were replaced by 
  jet aircraft); thus becoming known by some as an "anachronism". The aircraft was 
  nicknamed "Spad", after the French World War I fighter.
