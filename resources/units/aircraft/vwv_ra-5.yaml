  The North American A-5 Vigilante is an American carrier-based supersonic bomber 
  designed and built by North American Aviation (NAA) for the United States Navy.
  Development of the A-5 had started in 1954 as a private venture by NAA, who sought 
  to produce a capable supersonic long-distance bomber as a successor to the abortive 
  North American XA2J Super Savage. It was a large and complex aircraft that 
  incorporated several innovative features, such as being the first bomber to feature 
  a digital computer, while its ability to attain speeds of up to Mach 2 while 
  carrying a nuclear strike payload was also relatively ambitious for the era. 
  The US Navy saw the value of such a bomber, leading to a contract for its full 
  development and production being issued to the firm on 29 August 1956. The type 
  performed its first flight just over two years later, on 31 August 1958. 
  The Vigilante was introduced by the US Navy during June 1961; it succeeded the 
  Douglas A-3 Skywarrior as the Navy's primary nuclear strike aircraft, but its 
  service in this capacity was relatively brief due to the deemphasising of manned 
  bombers in American nuclear strategy. A far larger quantity of the RA-5C tactical 
  strike reconnaissance variant were also procured by the service, which saw 
  extensive service during the Vietnam War. It also established several world records 
  in both long-distance speed and altitude categories. During the mid-1970s, the 
  withdrawal of the type commenced after a relatively short service life, largely due 
  to the aircraft being expensive and complex to operate, as well being a victim of 
  post-Vietnam military cutbacks.
