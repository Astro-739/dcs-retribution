  ) or ZTZ-99 is a Chinese third generation main battle tank (MBT). The vehicle was a 
  replacement for the aging Type 88 introduced in the late 1980s. The Type 99 MBT was 
  China's first mass-produced third-generation main battle tank. Combining modular composite
  armour and tandem-charge defeating ERA, 125 mm smoothbore gun with ATGM-capability, high
  mobility, digital systems and optics, the Type 99 represents a shift towards rapid 
  modernization by the PLA."
