description: "<p>This campaign is about defeating an Integrated Air Defence System (IADS). The IADS can be taken down by striking its communication towers or power sources, or directly attacking its SAMs. The enemy has a significant number of ground and air assets, making this a challenging campaign, but also providing a lot of targets to strike. Expect a lot of red air activity right from turn one (squadrons are set to begin full). Make sure to destroy more assets each turn than you lose, because the enemy income is double that of yours.<br><br>The campaign is mainly designed for a group of players using weasel tactics, but can also be played by a single player after adjusting some settings.<br><br>Recommended settings for a group of players:<br>- Use High Digit SAMs and Skynet<br>- Keep default income multipliers<br>- Turn off display of Air Defenses during mission planning<br>Recommended settings for single player SEAD/DEAD missions:<br>- Use Skynet, but turn off High Digit SAMs<br>- Reduce enemy income muiltiplier<br>Recommended settings for single player Strike missions (with AI SEAD mssions):<br>- Turn off Skynet and High Digit SAMs<br>- Reduce enemy income muiltiplier<br><br>Note:<br>- Income multipliers are set to 0.7 (lower than 1.0) to include many assets to strike and still keep the available income at a lower level to not increase the amount of frontline units such that it hits the computer CPU limits<br>- Squadrons are set to start full, which provides high red air activity right from the start<br>- Mission duration is set to 30 min (all enemy missions airborne before 30 min), which will result in a total mission duration of about 1 hour<br>- Advanced IADS setting should be set to On<br><br>This campaign does not represent any historical time period or events. It is based on the Assault on Damascus campaign by HolyOrangeJuice, which is again based on the Battle for Golan Heights campaign by Khopa.</p>"
